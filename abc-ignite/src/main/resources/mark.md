# ABC API Overview

The **ABC API** is built around REST principles, offering clear, resource-oriented URLs and predictable interactions. It supports form-encoded request bodies, returns responses in JSON format, and adheres to standard HTTP verbs, status codes, and authentication practices.

## Key Features

- **Test Mode Support**  
  Use the API in **test mode** to simulate requests without affecting live data or interacting with banking networks. The modeâ€”**live** or **test**â€”is determined by the API key used to authenticate the request.

- **Bulk Update Support**  
  Perform batch operations with the API. Note that each request must target only **one object** at a time.

- **Versioned & Account-Specific Behavior**  
  API behavior may vary across accounts due to versioning and customized functionality tailored to individual users.

- **Personalized Documentation**  
  Log in with your **test API key** to view documentation and examples specific to your account and data.
